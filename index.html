            <p class="bio">I am a Washington D.C. based Full Stack Engineer with a passion for web development and software engineering.
              Two things I can't do without: coffee and technology. I am also an avid soccer player, would-be weightlifter,
              and occasional hiker. I look at new opportunities and problems as unique puzzles to be solved and I'm always
              looking for my next challenge.</p>

          <div class="about">
            <p class="bio">I've always been fascinated by programming. I made my first program when I was eight - a simple dominoes game
              in Microsoft Visual Basic. From that point on I had been bitten by the programming bug. At the University of
              Virginia, I double majored in Biochemistry and Computer Science and worked one summer in a genetics lab, where
              I helped create bioinformatics software to detect cancer on bacterial cells using Bayesian statistics and the
              Viterbi path algorithm. After college, I decided to take a web development bootcamp with Thinkful Inc. to further
              my development skills and build a career in this exciting industry.</p>
            <p class="bio">I am currently looking for work and can be contacted via the contact info at the bottom of the page. </p>

                  <p>The Book Nook is an app that allows you to save and display your favorite works of literature. You can

                    you enjoy the most. You can also view friends' profiles and catch up on their literary adventures. I
                    used the GoodReads API to enable users to find and update their favorite books and authors. Technology
                    used: HTML5, CSS, React/Redux, JQuery, Node.js, Express. </p>
